The latest European Atlas of herpetofauna was published in the 1990's and Luomus was involved in the project as well. An intensified collection of the data will start in Finland in 2015 in order to update the current status of the species.

Of the species assessed, 2,667 species or 11.9% were classified as threatened. The proportion of threatened species has increased compared to the previous assessment in 2010 when 10.5% of the assessed species were classified as threatened. The development trend indicates that the target of halting the increase in the vulnerability of Finnish species has not been met.</p><p>The majority of threatened species live primarily in forests (31.2%) and in rural biotopes and other cultural habitats (24.4%). Overall, most species live in forests and rural biotopes, which partially explains the large number of threatened species in these biotopes. However, the proportionally largest number of threatened species is found in alpine habitats where only 3.6% of all assessed species are found but no fewer than 37.9% are threatened.</p><p>Changes in the forest environment are the most significant cause of threat to species, as is the case with 733 threatened species. These changes include forest management activities, the reduction of old-growth forests and large trees as well as decreasing amounts of dead and decaying wood. The second most common threat to species is the overgrowing of open habitats, which is the primary cause of threat to 639 species. Climate change poses a threat to, in particular, species in fell areas.</p>",
