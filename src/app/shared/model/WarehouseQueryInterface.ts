/**
 * Query interface for warehouse
 *
 * @property includeNonValidTaxa By default, query results include also entries where target name does not match taxonomy.
 * To getList only entries where one and only one taxon matches given target name, set this parameter to false.
 * @property taxonId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of a taxon. Use Taxonomy-API to find identifiers.
 * Will only return entries where reported target name matches one of the names given to this and only this taxon.
 * Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple times. When multiple values
 * are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property target Same as taxon, but system resolves identifier of the taxon based on the given target name.

 * If no such match can be resolved (name does not exist in taxonomy), will filter based on the given verbatim target
 * name (case insensitive). Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple times.
 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.

 * Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple times.
 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property administrativeStatusId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of an administrative status.

 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property redListStatusId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of red list status.
 * Use Metadata-API to find identifiers. Will return entries of taxons that are marked with the red list status.

 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property finnish Filter only those taxons that are finnish or are not finnish.
 * @property invasive Filter only those taxons that are invasive or are not invasive.
 * @property countryId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of a country. Use Area-API to find identifiers.
 * Will return entries where the country has been identified using coordinates or name without contradictions.
 * Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple times.
 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property finnishMunicipalityId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of a finnish municipality.

 * or name without contradictions. Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter
 * multiple times. When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property biogeographicalProvinceId Filter based on URI or Qname identifier of a biogeographical province.
 * Use Area-API to find identifiers. Will return entries where the province has been identified using coordinates or
 * name without contradictions. Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple
 * times. When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property area Filter using country, municipality or province name or locality. If identifier is resolved for
 * country or municipality, filters using that identifier. If area name does not match any identifier,
 * search from country verbatim, municipality verbatim, province verbatim and locality using exact match case
 * insensitive search. Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving the HTTP parameter multiple times.
 * When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property time Filter using event date. Date can be a full date or part of a date,

 * Short forms for \&quot;last N days\&quot; can be used: 0 is today, -1 is yesterday and so on;
 * for example -7/0 isa range between 7 days ago and today. Multiple values are seperated by a comma (,) or by giving
 * the HTTP parameter multiple times. When multiple values are given, this is an OR search.
 * @property yearMonth Time filter for statistics query. Uses same syntax as @property time.
 * @property dayOfYearBegin Filter using day of year. For example day of year begin &#x3D; 100, day of year end &#x3D;
