The latest European Atlas of herpetofauna was published in the 1990's and Luomus was involved in the project as well. An intensified collection of the data will start in Finland in 2015 in order to update the current status of the species.

Of the species assessed, 2,667 species or 11.9% were classified as threatened. The proportion of threatened species has increased compared to the previous assessment in 2010 when 10.5% of the assessed species were classified as threatened. The development trend indicates that the target of halting the increase in the vulnerability of Finnish species has not been met.</p><p>The majority of threatened species live primarily in forests (31.2%) and in rural biotopes and other cultural habitats (24.4%). Overall, most species live in forests and rural biotopes, which partially explains the large number of threatened species in these biotopes. However, the proportionally largest number of threatened species is found in alpine habitats where only 3.6% of all assessed species are found but no fewer than 37.9% are threatened.</p><p>Changes in the forest environment are the most significant cause of threat to species, as is the case with 733 threatened species. These changes include forest management activities, the reduction of old-growth forests and large trees as well as decreasing amounts of dead and decaying wood. The second most common threat to species is the overgrowing of open habitats, which is the primary cause of threat to 639 species. Climate change poses a threat to, in particular, species in fell areas.</p>",

For example for Finnish observations we check that the reported municipality and the coordinates do not conflict. Observations that do not pass these validations are considered to have \"issues\" and are not shown by default by the search.

If you want to ignore the observations for which no coordinates were originally reported, check this filter.",

Suggestions are matched to your input if they are found in the taxonomic database. Matches include scientific names (including synonyms) and vernacular names (in Finnish, English, etc.). Selecting a taxon will return records of the specified taxon's child taxa (e.g., selecting a genus will return records of the species belonging to the genus)</p><p>2) Entering a name and pressing return without selecting a suggestion in the menu will return records that either match the input exactly for a taxon in the database (all name types), or are a full or a partial match for the taxon name as it was originally supplied to FinBIF.
