# Contributing

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue. Including an issue reproduction
(via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly
diagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  New code should follow the style used in the project.
*  We use [compodoc](https://compodoc.app/) for documentation.
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
